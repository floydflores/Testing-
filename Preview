    <h3 class="p">Hi, my name is Floyd Flores, nice to meet you</h3>
    <hr>
    <p class="p">I was a Nintendo fan as a child, I played a lot of games on my Wii back then. games arranging from Mario kart Wii to mods like Project M. 
    To this day, I am to this day still a Nintendo fan, I play a lot of old releases on the Nintendo switch and am still having a lot of fun 
    right now. I also play some other games on other consoles too, from CoD: Black ops III on the Xbox to Hot Wheels: Unleashed on the PS5. 
    Today I'm a Gardena senior high student doing well with all As on my report cards doing my best to pass and get a master's degree. I 
    wanted to start on Unity and start making my own games not just to enjoy and take pride in something I would've never learned before, but to 
    feel like someone and know what it feels like to be a video game designer.
