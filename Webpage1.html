        <h3 class="h"> What was the first ever tank? What did it look like? </h3>
        <hr>
        <p class="text">Well, the tank was a prototype to escort soldiers more safely, 
        while it didn't have any weapons, it was heavily armored and capable of moving through rough terrain at a very slow pace. 
        And despite it's slow efforts, Little Willie eventually got improvements and later transformed the battlefield. </p><br>
       <hr>
        <p class="text">The British developed the tank in response to the Trench Warfare during <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ww1&oq=WW1">WW1</a>. Later on, Ernest Swinton and William Hankey championed the idea of an 
        Armored vehicle. The men appealed to Winston Churchill, and to keep it a secret, production workers were told the vehicle would carry water on the battlefield. 
        When the tank was introduced, it had a slow performance, it also overheated and couldn't move through trenches, a second prototype called "Big Willie" was 
        introduced and it had better improvements, making it deemed ready for battle with it's first debut in the <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=battle+of+the+somme&oq=Battle+of+the+Somme">Battle of the Somme</a> known as the mark I. The first 
        batch of tanks were hot, noisy, and unwieldy and suffered mechanical malfunctions on the battlefield but people still saw potential, after further improvemnents 
        were made, at the Battle of Cambrai, 400 Mark IV,s proved much more successful capturing 8,000 troops and 100 guns.</p><br>
