        <p class="text">Today I'm learning to make video games on platforms, I learned a lot of basics just messing around with my games. 
        Now that I know a lot about what I can do in Scratch, I'm starting to improve on my coding skills and putting things together. I'm 
        still dreaming about using Unity though, I'm sure maybe I'll master that some day, but for now, I have this game that I hope you enjoy.
